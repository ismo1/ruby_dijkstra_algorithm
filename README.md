# Ruby implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm

This is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm. It can be used to determine the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.


## Notes ##

- This implementation has been written with non-oriented graphs in mind.
- Nodes can and nodes can virtually be anything (despite I use a structure).
